# Memory Bank: JK Logistics & Billing System

## Project Overview

**System Purpose**: Automated logistics document processing and billing system that extracts data from PDFs (LRs, Invoices, PODs) using OCR and generates client-specific consolidated bills.

**Core Problem Solved**: Eliminate manual data entry from diverse client logistics documents and automate the creation of complex, client-specific bulk bills.

**Implementation Strategy**: Pilot-first approach with a single client to validate technical viability before scaling.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### **Database Design**

- **PostgreSQL with Supabase**: Chosen for JSONB support and cloud deployment
- **Hybrid Data Model**: Relational core + JSONB for client-specific flexibility
- **Status-Driven Workflow**: Single table with status field vs. multiple staging tables
- **Template Inheritance**: Hierarchical model for client branches to minimize duplication

### **Frontend Architecture**

- **React + Vite**: Modern development stack with fast HMR
- **Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion**: Professional UI with smooth animations
- **Component-based**: Modular design with reusable components
- **Client-side routing**: Single-page application with programmatic navigation

### **OCR Strategy**

- **Two-part system**: Separate OCR engine and Information Extraction
- **Open-source tools**: EasyOCR/PaddleOCR to avoid cloud API dependencies
- **Template-based extraction**: Coordinate + Anchor + Regex hybrid approach
- **Quality control**: Confidence scoring with human-in-the-loop validation

## Implementation Timeline & Log

### 2025-08-22: Templates → LR Integration Plan (Extraction, Pairing, Validation, Billing)

#### Objective
Connect client/branch templates to the LR upload flow so a single PDF with multiple Invoice–POD pairs is split, matched, extracted, human-validated, and stored for billing—simple, reliable, and scalable.

#### End-to-End Flow
1. Gatekeeping
   - Require active templates for both document types: invoice and pod (prefer branch-specific, fallback to base).
2. Upload + Trip Record
   - Upload PDF to `source_documents` and create `lorry_receipts` with `status = 'Pending_Validation'` and `source_pdf_path` (recommended small addition).
3. Asynchronous Extraction
   - Trigger OCR/Extraction job with `{ lr_id, client_id, branch_id, source_pdf_path }`.
   - Service splits pages, classifies (invoice vs pod), extracts invoice_number candidates, pairs invoice–pod pages, and runs template-based extraction (coordinate → anchor → regex).
   - For each matched pair, insert `invoices` rows with `{ lr_id, invoice_number, invoice_page_ref, pod_page_ref, raw_ocr_data }`.
   - `raw_ocr_data` keeps per-field `{ invoice_value, pod_value, method, confidence, conflict }`; orphans/low-confidence flagged for review.
4. Human Validation
   - UI renders one row per invoice with conflicts highlighted and POD rules enforced (`MANDATORY` vs `NOT_APPLICABLE`).
   - User resolves conflicts and saves clean values to `invoices.custom_data`.
   - When all rows meet requirements, set `lorry_receipts.status = 'Validated'`.
5. Billing
   - Bulk-billing selects `Validated` trips, generates Excel using `client_field_templates.display_order`, uploads to `generated_bills`, and archives via `generated_bill_files`.

#### Data Contracts
- Templates
  - `document_templates`: active template per `(client_id, branch_id|null, document_type in ['invoice','pod'])` with extraction methods.
  - `client_field_templates`: canonical field keys, display order, and `pod_requirement` for validation and billing.
- Extraction API (async)
  - Request: `{ lr_id, client_id, branch_id, source_pdf_path }` → Response: `{ job_id }`.
  - Service writes directly to `invoices` (upsert by unique `(lr_id, invoice_number)` for idempotency).
- Stored Results
  - `invoices.raw_ocr_data`: per-field values, confidence, conflict, and notes; `invoice_page_ref`/`pod_page_ref` store page image refs.
  - `invoices.custom_data`: final, user-validated values.

#### Matching Strategy (Practical Heuristics)
1. Classify pages using template anchors/keywords (e.g., “Tax Invoice”, “POD”).
2. Extract invoice_number candidates per page with confidence.
3. Pairing order:
   - Primary: exact invoice_number match (pick highest-confidence when multiples).
   - Secondary: adjacency heuristic (neighboring pages), then fuzzy match constrained to the LR.
4. Orphans are flagged `needs_review` for manual pairing in UI.

#### Minimal DB Additions (Recommended)
- `lorry_receipts.source_pdf_path TEXT` to track the uploaded file path and support reprocessing.
- Optional: `invoices.is_validated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` to simplify completeness checks (or infer from `custom_data`).

#### Operational Safeguards
- Gate LR upload if no active templates; allow base-template fallback.
- Low confidence or unclassified pages → flagged for human review.
- Idempotent extraction via `(lr_id, invoice_number)` unique key.
- Template drift handled via template `version` and `is_active` in `document_templates`.

#### FAQ
- Do users need to re-annotate after upload?
  - No. Once templates are created (coordinates/anchors/regex), the extraction service uses them automatically on upload. Users only validate and resolve conflicts. Manual input/pairing is needed only when templates are missing, pages are unmatched, or confidence is low.

#### Status
- Design approved and documented. Next: add `document_templates` table and (optional) `source_pdf_path`, scaffold extraction service hook, and build validation UI for `invoices` under an LR.

### 2025-08-22: Client Registration Hardening, Client Delete, and Branch Template Flow

#### Problems Addressed
- Clients could be registered without branches or template fields.
- The 3-dots action on client cards had no functional menu.
- No way to delete a client from the UI/service.
- Adding branches required a separate step to configure branch-specific fields (too many hops).

#### What Was Implemented
1. Client Registration Guardrails
   - UI now requires:
     - Client name (already present)
     - At least one branch
     - At least one template field (base or branch-specific)
   - Duplicate field-name detection (normalized to keys) for base and per-branch fields.
   - Tab-level red indicators for incomplete sections; inline validation summary; submit disabled until valid.
   - Files: `src/components/ClientRegistrationModal.jsx`

2. Client Actions Menu
   - Working 3-dots dropdown on client cards with actions:
     - Manage Branches
     - Setup Template
     - Delete Client (new)
   - Files: `src/pages/ClientManagement.jsx`

3. Delete Client (Hard Delete)
   - Service method `deleteClient(clientId)`; DB cascades handle branches/templates/etc.
   - Confirmation modal with cascade warning, progress and error states.
   - Files: `src/lib/clientRegistrationService.js`, `src/pages/ClientManagement.jsx`

4. Branch Template Fields—Inline and Modal
   - Inline fields during Add Branch: when creating a new branch, you can add its branch-specific template fields in the same edit panel; fields are created immediately after the branch is saved.
   - Auto-open Branch Template Fields modal after creation for further edits.
   - Added a “Template Fields” button on each branch row to open the modal at any time.
   - Files: `src/components/BranchManagementModal.jsx`, `src/components/BranchTemplateFieldsModal.jsx`, `src/lib/clientRegistrationService.js`

5. Template Setup Quick Add (Base Fields)
   - Temporary base-fields editor inside `TemplateSetupModal` to add client-wide fields without the annotation tool.
   - Files: `src/components/TemplateSetupModal.jsx`

#### UX/Behavioral Notes
- POD requirement meanings:
  - NOT_APPLICABLE: field isn’t required on POD; can be captured from LR/Invoice.
  - MANDATORY: must be present/verified on POD; should block validation if missing.
- Validation surfaces clearly on tabs and above the submit button.

#### Business Value
- Prevents empty/invalid registrations and data integrity issues.
- Faster onboarding: branches can be created with their fields in one step.
- Admin hygiene: clients can be removed safely with clear warning.

#### Next Steps
1. Optional soft-delete for clients (`is_deleted`) and filtered queries.
2. Edit/update for existing template fields (service + UI).
3. Branch templates preview: show effective (base + branch) fields in one view.
4. Tie POD requirement into future validation UI to enforce status transitions.

### **2025-08-22: White Page Issue Resolution & System Stabilization**

#### **Problem Identified:**
User encountered a white page error after implementing multi-branch functionality, likely caused by RLS policy conflicts and complex GSTIN validation.

#### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **RLS Policy Mismatch**: Database had policies requiring authenticated users, but app was using anonymous key
2. **Complex GSTIN Validation**: Advanced validation logic was causing JavaScript errors
3. **Service Role Dependency**: supabaseAdmin client required environment variables that weren't set

#### **Solutions Implemented:**
1. **RLS Policy Fix**: User successfully implemented anonymous access policies for development
2. **GSTIN Validation Removal**: Completely removed complex validation logic that was breaking the app
3. **Simplified Service Layer**: Reverted to standard supabase client to eliminate dependencies
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: Added proper null checks and error boundaries

#### **Key Fixes Applied:**
- **Database Policies**: Anonymous access policies for all tables (development environment)
- **Service Simplification**: Removed supabaseAdmin dependency and complex validation
- **Null-Safe Operations**: Added proper null checks for optional GSTIN fields
- **Modal Restoration**: Re-enabled Branch Management functionality after stabilization

#### **Files Modified for Stability:**
- FIXED: `src/lib/clientRegistrationService.js` (simplified, removed validation)
- FIXED: `src/components/ClientRegistrationModal.jsx` (simplified data flow)
- FIXED: `src/pages/ClientManagement.jsx` (restored functionality)
- ADDED: `Database/temp-dev-policies.sql` (development RLS policies)

#### **Current System State:**
- ✅ **Application Loads**: White page issue resolved
- ✅ **Client Registration**: Simplified registration working
- ✅ **Branch Management**: Full functionality restored
- ✅ **Database Access**: Anonymous policies allow development work
- ✅ **Error-Free Operation**: Removed validation complexity that caused crashes

#### **Next Steps for Production:**
1. Implement proper authentication system
2. Replace anonymous policies with role-based access
3. Add back GSTIN validation with better error handling
4. Set up service role key for administrative operations

### **2025-08-22: Project Analysis & Strategic Planning**

#### **What Was Done:**

1. **Comprehensive System Analysis**

   - Reviewed existing frontend implementation (React components, routing, UI)
   - Analyzed database schema (PostgreSQL with proper relationships)
   - Identified critical gaps: missing backend integration, no OCR implementation
2. **Strategic Documentation Creation**

   - Created `OCR-Strategy.instructions.md` with detailed technical approach
   - Updated `Documentation.instructions.md` to emphasize pilot-first strategy
   - Established 5-phase implementation roadmap (8-11 weeks total)
3. **Database Schema Validation**

   - Confirmed existing schema supports the planned features
   - Identified need for additional tables: `document_templates`, `extraction_results`, `template_performance`
   - Fixed syntax error in `client_branches` table (missing comma)

#### **Reasoning:**

- **Gap Analysis**: Current system has excellent UI but no core functionality (OCR, data persistence)
- **Pilot Strategy**: Reduces risk by validating technical approach with one client first
- **Documentation-First**: Ensures long-term context preservation and clear roadmap

#### **Current State:**

- ✅ Professional frontend UI with all major components
- ✅ Solid database schema design
- ✅ Comprehensive technical documentation
- ❌ No backend integration (Supabase CRUD operations)
- ❌ No OCR engine implementation
- ❌ No file upload system
- ❌ No template annotation tool

#### **Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Fix Database Schema** (High Priority)

   - Correct syntax error in `client_branches` table
   - Add OCR-related tables from strategy document
2. **Implement Core Backend Integration** (High Priority)

   - Connect client registration form to Supabase
   - Implement basic CRUD operations
   - Set up file upload system
3. **Build Template Annotation Tool** (Medium Priority)

   - Deploy corrected schema to Supabase
2. **Simplify Form Structure** (High - 2-3 hours)

   - Remove: `invoice1Fields`, `invoice2Fields`, `podFields`, `billFields` sections
   - Add: Branch creation interface
   - Add: Template field configuration that maps to `client_field_templates`
3. **Implement Supabase Integration** (High - 3-4 hours)

   - Set up environment variables
   - Create client insertion function
   - Create branch insertion function
   - Create template field insertion function
4. **Test Complete Flow** (Medium - 1 hour)

   - End-to-end client registration with real data persistence
   - Verify database relationships and constraints

#### **Next Immediate Action:**

~~Fix database schema syntax error and implement Supabase CRUD operations for client registration.~~ **COMPLETED**

**Status Update:** ✅ **Client Registration Core Implementation Complete**
